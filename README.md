Dayz Standalone UI Admin Tool



## Changelog

See CHANGELOG.md

## Notes

27.11.2018
Today an Update will roll out critical errors gonna be fixed 
1. Menu opens for everyone when admin opens it (players can't run any command)
2. I need to check why for some ppl it's not working my guess is it does not work via launcher
3. Some always getting kicked because modified data (need to talk to ppl to see what they are doing wrong and update installation guide 

That are the main problems I came across today as soon as I am back home I am gonna address those. 
That would be the day one patch.
Sorry for that !

It is probably bad written

It can be done better

It has surely bugs i dont know of

There will be someone who creates an actuall good Admin Tool
